				<a class="project_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.aliabediweb.com/sample_page_1_index.html">View Website</a>
				<a class="project_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/aliabediweb/WEBWARE">View Code on GitHub</a>
					<p class="text">A landing page is a marketing or advertising website designed to inform the visitor about a brand, company, or product. This landing page is informative and simple. The page contains three tabs where users can click to expand the content within that tab. The first tab contains a brief introduction and history of the brand. The second tab showcases the current products with a table layout or with a slideshow, depending on the device that is accessing the website. The third tab contains a contact form.</p>
					<p class="text">All of the content of the website is displayed on a single page, which keeps the website simple and prevents the user from having to click on links to access the information on a separate page</p>
					<p class="text">This website is responsive. The content layout of the second tab changes depending on the screen width. If the user is viewing the page from a laptop or monitor, all of the current products are visible, and when the user is viewing the page from a mobile device or tablet, a slideshow displays one product at a time.</p>
			<h4 class="next_project">Small Business Website for Florist</h4>
				<a class="project_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.aliabediweb.com/sample_page_2_index.html">View Website</a>
				<a class="project_link" target="_blank" href="https://www.github.com/aliabediweb/AE-Florist">View Code on GitHub</a>
					<p class="text">The purpose of this project was to create a website for a small business. The business, which is a florist, needs to be able to organize the different types of products they sell.</p>
					<p class="text">Each type of flower has its own page. The flowers are also sorted by occasion, such as Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. Having the products organized into separate pages keeps the website clean and prevents the user from being overwhelmed by images. This also drastically reduces loading time; instead of the server trying to load every single high-definition image onto one page, each page only holds a maximum of 6 high-definition images which can load much faster.</p>
					<p class="text">This website is also responsive. The font sizes and image width change depending on the type of device that is accessing the website. Modern websites must be developed for use with all types of devices - from mobile phones to desktop monitors - in order to be accessible for every user.</p>
